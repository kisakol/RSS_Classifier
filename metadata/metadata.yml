  Profiles
description: "Identification of Unique Rectal Cancer Specific Subtypes\nMolecular
  subtyping in colorectal cancers revealed many biological insights regarding colorectal
  tumour development. However, the treatment setting differences between colon and
  rectal cancers suggest that they can be treated separately in the molecular level
  analysis too. Here, we trained an XgBoost Classifier model to predict rectal-specific
  subtypes based on gene expression profiles of treatment-naive rectal samples. The
  pre-trained model takes a data frame as an input and predicts the associated subtypes
  for each patient. \n\nInstructions:\nThe sample input file format can be seen in
  the 'rectal182.txt 'file. The data frame format looks like this:\nRows: Sample IDs,
  Columns:  gene names (hugo symbols), and Values: log2 scaled gene expression counts.
  \nHow it works: The model groups the genes that are pre-defined in the 'gene_modules/filtered_gene_modules.txt'
  file and takes the median to represent each module. Then calls the pre-defined XgBoost
  Classifier to predict sample types. This code outputs a tab-separated file with
  two columns: the first column is the Sample IDs of the input file and the second
  column is the predicted rectal-specific subtype (RSS1/2/3).\nRun: Users can change
  the path to their desired gene expression matrix input and run the test.py file.
  or import the rss_classification python file and call the rss_classifier function
  as instructed."
